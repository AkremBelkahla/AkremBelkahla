# 👋 Hi, I'm Akrem

I'm a **full-stack developer** with over 10 years of experience, focused on building modern web applications using **React/Next.js**, **Laravel**, and **WordPress**. I help clients ship fast, scalable, and maintainable products—whether it's a SaaS app, dashboard, internal tool, e-commerce platform, or custom website.

💻 I have strong skills in building **modern frontends with React/Next.js** (SPA, SSR, SSG), integrating clean UI from Figma/Adobe XD using **Tailwind CSS** and **Bootstrap**, and connecting them to robust APIs built with **Laravel** or **Node/Express**. I also have extensive experience in **advanced WordPress development** (custom themes, plugins, multilingual, and complex setups).
